# Rustler Precompiled Action

This is a GitHub Action that builds library crates conditionally using [cross],
and renames the final library file to the naming expected by [RustlerPrecompiled].

It's **important to notice that this Action won't install Rust**. So you need to
install it first.

## Inputs

The following inputs are accepted:

| Name              | Description   | Required | Default   |
|-------------------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| `project-name`    |  Name of the crate that is being built. This is the same of the Cargo.toml of the crate.    | true  |   |
| `project-version` |  The version to use in the name of the lib. This mostly matches the Elixir package version. | true  |   |
| `target`          |  The Rust target we are building to. | true  |   |
| `nif-version`     |  The NIF version that we are aiming to. | false   | `"2.16"`  |
| `use-cross`       |  If the target requires the usage of cross. | false   |   |
| `cross-version`   |  The version desired for cross, the tool that builds for multiple plataforms. | false  | `"v0.2.4"`  |
